<h2>CANTO I</h2>
<br>

<p>
O'er better waves to speed her rapid course<br>
The light bark of my genius lifts the sail,<br>
Well pleas'd to leave so cruel sea behind;<br>
And of that second region will I sing,<br>
In which the human spirit from sinful blot<br>
Is purg'd, and for ascent to Heaven prepares.<br>
<br>Here, O ye hallow'd Nine! for in your train<br>
I follow, here the deadened strain revive;<br>
Nor let Calliope refuse to sound<br>
A somewhat higher song, of that loud tone,<br>
Which when the wretched birds of chattering note<br>
Had heard, they of forgiveness lost all hope.<br>
<br>Sweet hue of eastern sapphire, that was spread<br>
O'er the serene aspect of the pure air,<br>
High up as the first circle, to mine eyes<br>
Unwonted joy renew'd, soon as I 'scap'd<br>
Forth from the atmosphere of deadly gloom,<br>
That had mine eyes and bosom fill'd with grief.<br>
The radiant planet, that to love invites,<br>
Made all the orient laugh, and veil'd beneath<br>
The Pisces' light, that in his escort came.<br>

<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/01-19.jpg"><img alt="01-19th.jpg (38K)" src="images/01-19th.jpg" height="477" width="432"></a>
<br><br><br><br>

<br>To the right hand I turn'd, and fix'd my mind<br>
On the' other pole attentive, where I saw<br>
Four stars ne'er seen before save by the ken<br>
Of our first parents. &nbsp;Heaven of their rays<br>
Seem'd joyous. &nbsp;O thou northern site, bereft<br>
Indeed, and widow'd, since of these depriv'd!<br>
<br>As from this view I had desisted, straight<br>
Turning a little tow'rds the other pole,<br>
There from whence now the wain had disappear'd,<br>
I saw an old man standing by my side<br>
Alone, so worthy of rev'rence in his look,<br>
That ne'er from son to father more was ow'd.<br>
Low down his beard and mix'd with hoary white<br>
Descended, like his locks, which parting fell<br>
Upon his breast in double fold. &nbsp;The beams<br>
Of those four luminaries on his face<br>
So brightly shone, and with such radiance clear<br>
Deck'd it, that I beheld him as the sun.<br>
<br>"Say who are ye, that stemming the blind stream,<br>
Forth from th' eternal prison-house have fled?"<br>
He spoke and moved those venerable plumes.<br>
"Who hath conducted, or with lantern sure<br>
Lights you emerging from the depth of night,<br>
That makes the infernal valley ever black?<br>
Are the firm statutes of the dread abyss<br>
Broken, or in high heaven new laws ordain'd,<br>
That thus, condemn'd, ye to my caves approach?"<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/01-49.jpg"><img alt="01-49th.jpg (35K)" src="images/01-49th.jpg" height="477" width="430"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<br>My guide, then laying hold on me, by words<br>
And intimations given with hand and head,<br>
Made my bent knees and eye submissive pay<br>
Due reverence; then thus to him replied.<br>
<br>"Not of myself I come; a Dame from heaven<br>
Descending, had besought me in my charge<br>
To bring. &nbsp;But since thy will implies, that more<br>
Our true condition I unfold at large,<br>
Mine is not to deny thee thy request.<br>
This mortal ne'er hath seen the farthest gloom.<br>
But erring by his folly had approach'd<br>
So near, that little space was left to turn.<br>
Then, as before I told, I was dispatch'd<br>
To work his rescue, and no way remain'd<br>
Save this which I have ta'en. &nbsp;I have display'd<br>
Before him all the regions of the bad;<br>
And purpose now those spirits to display,<br>
That under thy command are purg'd from sin.<br>
How I have brought him would be long to say.<br>
From high descends the virtue, by whose aid<br>
I to thy sight and hearing him have led.<br>
Now may our coming please thee. &nbsp;In the search<br>
Of liberty he journeys: that how dear<br>
They know, who for her sake have life refus'd.<br>
Thou knowest, to whom death for her was sweet<br>
In Utica, where thou didst leave those weeds,<br>
That in the last great day will shine so bright.<br>
For us the' eternal edicts are unmov'd:<br>
He breathes, and I am free of Minos' power,<br>
Abiding in that circle where the eyes<br>
Of thy chaste Marcia beam, who still in look<br>
Prays thee, O hallow'd spirit! to own her shine.<br>
Then by her love we' implore thee, let us pass<br>
Through thy sev'n regions; for which best thanks<br>
I for thy favour will to her return,<br>
If mention there below thou not disdain."<br>
<br>"Marcia so pleasing in my sight was found,"<br>
He then to him rejoin'd, "while I was there,<br>
That all she ask'd me I was fain to grant.<br>
Now that beyond the' accursed stream she dwells,<br>
She may no longer move me, by that law,<br>
Which was ordain'd me, when I issued thence.<br>
Not so, if Dame from heaven, as thou sayst,<br>
Moves and directs thee; then no flattery needs.<br>
Enough for me that in her name thou ask.<br>
Go therefore now: and with a slender reed<br>
See that thou duly gird him, and his face<br>
Lave, till all sordid stain thou wipe from thence.<br>
For not with eye, by any cloud obscur'd,<br>
Would it be seemly before him to come,<br>
Who stands the foremost minister in heaven.<br>
This islet all around, there far beneath,<br>
Where the wave beats it, on the oozy bed<br>
Produces store of reeds. No other plant,<br>
Cover'd with leaves, or harden'd in its stalk,<br>
There lives, not bending to the water's sway.<br>
After, this way return not; but the sun<br>
Will show you, that now rises, where to take<br>
The mountain in its easiest ascent."<br>
<br>He disappear'd; and I myself uprais'd<br>
Speechless, and to my guide retiring close,<br>
Toward him turn'd mine eyes. &nbsp;He thus began;<br>
"My son! observant thou my steps pursue.<br>
We must retreat to rearward, for that way<br>
The champain to its low extreme declines."<br>
<br>The dawn had chas'd the matin hour of prime,<br>
Which deaf before it, so that from afar<br>
I spy'd the trembling of the ocean stream.<br>
<br>We travers'd the deserted plain, as one<br>
Who, wander'd from his track, thinks every step<br>
Trodden in vain till he regain the path.<br>
<br>When we had come, where yet the tender dew<br>
Strove with the sun, and in a place, where fresh<br>
The wind breath'd o'er it, while it slowly dried;<br>
Both hands extended on the watery grass<br>
My master plac'd, in graceful act and kind.<br>
Whence I of his intent before appriz'd,<br>
Stretch'd out to him my cheeks suffus'd with tears.<br>
There to my visage he anew restor'd<br>
That hue, which the dun shades of hell conceal'd.<br>
<br>Then on the solitary shore arriv'd,<br>
That never sailing on its waters saw<br>
Man, that could after measure back his course,<br>
He girt me in such manner as had pleas'd<br>
Him who instructed, and O, strange to tell!<br>
As he selected every humble plant,<br>
Wherever one was pluck'd, another there<br>
Resembling, straightway in its place arose.</p>

<h2>CANTO II</h2>
<br>

<p>Now had the sun to that horizon reach'd,<br>
That covers, with the most exalted point<br>
Of its meridian circle, Salem's walls,<br>
And night, that opposite to him her orb<br>
Sounds, from the stream of Ganges issued forth,<br>
Holding the scales, that from her hands are dropp'd<br>
When she reigns highest: so that where I was,<br>
Aurora's white and vermeil-tinctur'd cheek<br>
To orange turn'd as she in age increas'd.<br>
<br>Meanwhile we linger'd by the water's brink,<br>
Like men, who, musing on their road, in thought<br>
Journey, while motionless the body rests.<br>
When lo! as near upon the hour of dawn,<br>
Through the thick vapours Mars with fiery beam<br>
Glares down in west, over the ocean floor;<br>
So seem'd, what once again I hope to view,<br>
A light so swiftly coming through the sea,<br>
No winged course might equal its career.<br>
From which when for a space I had withdrawn<br>
Thine eyes, to make inquiry of my guide,<br>
Again I look'd and saw it grown in size<br>
And brightness: thou on either side appear'd<br>
Something, but what I knew not of bright hue,<br>
And by degrees from underneath it came<br>
Another. &nbsp;My preceptor silent yet<br>
Stood, while the brightness, that we first discern'd,<br>
Open'd the form of wings: then when he knew<br>
The pilot, cried aloud, "Down, down; bend low<br>
Thy knees; behold God's angel: fold thy hands:<br>
Now shalt thou see true Ministers indeed."<br>



<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/02-27.jpg"><img alt="02-27th.jpg (33K)" src="images/02-27th.jpg" height="476" width="436"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


Lo how all human means he sets at naught!<br>
So that nor oar he needs, nor other sail<br>
Except his wings, between such distant shores.<br>
Lo how straight up to heaven he holds them rear'd,<br>
Winnowing the air with those eternal plumes,<br>
That not like mortal hairs fall off or change!"<br>
<br>As more and more toward us came, more bright<br>
Appear'd the bird of God, nor could the eye<br>
Endure his splendor near: I mine bent down.<br>
He drove ashore in a small bark so swift<br>
And light, that in its course no wave it drank.<br>
The heav'nly steersman at the prow was seen,<br>
Visibly written blessed in his looks.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/02-42.jpg"><img alt="02-42th.jpg (31K)" src="images/02-42th.jpg" height="477" width="427"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


Within a hundred spirits and more there sat.<br>
"In Exitu Israel de Aegypto;"<br>
All with one voice together sang, with what<br>
In the remainder of that hymn is writ.<br>
Then soon as with the sign of holy cross<br>
He bless'd them, they at once leap'd out on land,<br>
The swiftly as he came return'd. The crew,<br>
There left, appear'd astounded with the place,<br>
Gazing around as one who sees new sights.<br>
<br>From every side the sun darted his beams,<br>
And with his arrowy radiance from mid heav'n<br>
Had chas'd the Capricorn, when that strange tribe<br>
Lifting their eyes towards us: "If ye know,<br>
Declare what path will Lead us to the mount."<br>
<br>Them Virgil answer'd. &nbsp;"Ye suppose perchance<br>
Us well acquainted with this place: but here,<br>
We, as yourselves, are strangers. &nbsp;Not long erst<br>
We came, before you but a little space,<br>
By other road so rough and hard, that now<br>
The' ascent will seem to us as play." &nbsp;The spirits,<br>
Who from my breathing had perceiv'd I liv'd,<br>
Grew pale with wonder. &nbsp;As the multitude<br>
Flock round a herald, sent with olive branch,<br>
To hear what news he brings, and in their haste<br>
Tread one another down, e'en so at sight<br>
Of me those happy spirits were fix'd, each one<br>
Forgetful of its errand, to depart,<br>
Where cleans'd from sin, it might be made all fair.<br>
<br>Then one I saw darting before the rest<br>
With such fond ardour to embrace me, I<br>
To do the like was mov'd. &nbsp;O shadows vain<br>
Except in outward semblance! thrice my hands<br>
I clasp'd behind it, they as oft return'd<br>
Empty into my breast again. &nbsp;Surprise<br>
I needs must think was painted in my looks,<br>
For that the shadow smil'd and backward drew.<br>
To follow it I hasten'd, but with voice<br>
Of sweetness it enjoin'd me to desist.<br>
Then who it was I knew, and pray'd of it,<br>
To talk with me, it would a little pause.<br>
It answered: "Thee as in my mortal frame<br>
I lov'd, so loos'd forth it I love thee still,<br>
And therefore pause; but why walkest thou here?"<br>
<br>"Not without purpose once more to return,<br>
Thou find'st me, my Casella, where I am<br>
Journeying this way;" I said, "but how of thee<br>
Hath so much time been lost?" &nbsp;He answer'd straight:<br>
"No outrage hath been done to me, if he<br>
Who when and whom he chooses takes, me oft<br>
This passage hath denied, since of just will<br>
His will he makes. &nbsp;These three months past indeed,<br>
He, whose chose to enter, with free leave<br>
Hath taken; whence I wand'ring by the shore<br>
Where Tyber's wave grows salt, of him gain'd kind<br>
Admittance, at that river's mouth, tow'rd which<br>
His wings are pointed, for there always throng<br>
All such as not to Archeron descend."<br>
<br>Then I: "If new laws have not quite destroy'd<br>
Memory and use of that sweet song of love,<br>
That while all my cares had power to 'swage;<br>
Please thee with it a little to console<br>
My spirit, that incumber'd with its frame,<br>
Travelling so far, of pain is overcome."<br>
<br>"Love that discourses in my thoughts." &nbsp;He then<br>
Began in such soft accents, that within<br>
The sweetness thrills me yet. &nbsp;My gentle guide<br>
And all who came with him, so well were pleas'd,<br>
That seem'd naught else might in their thoughts have room.<br>
<br>Fast fix'd in mute attention to his notes<br>
We stood, when lo! that old man venerable<br>
Exclaiming, "How is this, ye tardy spirits?<br>
What negligence detains you loit'ring here?<br>
Run to the mountain to cast off those scales,<br>
That from your eyes the sight of God conceal."<br>
<br>As a wild flock of pigeons, to their food<br>
Collected, blade or tares, without their pride<br>
Accustom'd, and in still and quiet sort,<br>
If aught alarm them, suddenly desert<br>
Their meal, assail'd by more important care;<br>
So I that new-come troop beheld, the song<br>
Deserting, hasten to the mountain's side,<br>
As one who goes yet where he tends knows not.<br>
<br>Nor with less hurried step did we depart.</p>


<br><br>

<h2>CANTO III</h2>
<br>


<p>Them sudden flight had scatter'd over the plain,<br>
Turn'd tow'rds the mountain, whither reason's voice<br>
Drives us; I to my faithful company<br>
Adhering, left it not. &nbsp;For how of him<br>
Depriv'd, might I have sped, or who beside<br>
Would o'er the mountainous tract have led my steps<br>
He with the bitter pang of self-remorse<br>
Seem'd smitten. &nbsp;O clear conscience and upright<br>
How doth a little fling wound thee sore!<br>
<br>Soon as his feet desisted (slack'ning pace),<br>
From haste, that mars all decency of act,<br>
My mind, that in itself before was wrapt,<br>
Its thoughts expanded, as with joy restor'd:<br>
And full against the steep ascent I set<br>
My face, where highest to heav'n its top o'erflows.<br>
<br>The sun, that flar'd behind, with ruddy beam<br>
Before my form was broken; for in me<br>
His rays resistance met. &nbsp;I turn'd aside<br>
With fear of being left, when I beheld<br>
Only before myself the ground obscur'd.<br>
When thus my solace, turning him around,<br>
Bespake me kindly: "Why distrustest thou?<br>
Believ'st not I am with thee, thy sure guide?<br>
It now is evening there, where buried lies<br>
The body, in which I cast a shade, remov'd<br>
To Naples from Brundusium's wall. &nbsp;Nor thou<br>
Marvel, if before me no shadow fall,<br>
More than that in the sky element<br>
One ray obstructs not other. &nbsp;To endure<br>
Torments of heat and cold extreme, like frames<br>
That virtue hath dispos'd, which how it works<br>
Wills not to us should be reveal'd. &nbsp;Insane<br>
Who hopes, our reason may that space explore,<br>
Which holds three persons in one substance knit.<br>
Seek not the wherefore, race of human kind;<br>
Could ye have seen the whole, no need had been<br>
For Mary to bring forth. &nbsp;Moreover ye<br>
Have seen such men desiring fruitlessly;<br>
To whose desires repose would have been giv'n,<br>
That now but serve them for eternal grief.<br>
I speak of Plato, and the Stagyrite,<br>
And others many more." &nbsp;And then he bent<br>
Downwards his forehead, and in troubled mood<br>
Broke off his speech. &nbsp;Meanwhile we had arriv'd<br>
Far as the mountain's foot, and there the rock<br>
Found of so steep ascent, that nimblest steps<br>
To climb it had been vain. &nbsp;The most remote<br>
Most wild untrodden path, in all the tract<br>
'Twixt Lerice and Turbia were to this<br>
A ladder easy' and open of access.<br>
<br>"Who knows on which hand now the steep declines?"<br>
My master said and paus'd, "so that he may<br>
Ascend, who journeys without aid of wine?"<br>
And while with looks directed to the ground<br>
The meaning of the pathway he explor'd,<br>
And I gaz'd upward round the stony height,<br>
Of spirits, that toward us mov'd their steps,<br>
Yet moving seem'd not, they so slow approach'd.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/03-50.jpg"><img alt="03-50th.jpg (35K)" src="images/03-50th.jpg" height="476" width="428"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<br>I thus my guide address'd: "Upraise thine eyes,<br>
Lo that way some, of whom thou may'st obtain<br>
Counsel, if of thyself thou find'st it not!"<br>
<br>Straightway he look'd, and with free speech replied:<br>
"Let us tend thither: they but softly come.<br>
And thou be firm in hope, my son belov'd."<br>
<br>Now was that people distant far in space<br>
A thousand paces behind ours, as much<br>
As at a throw the nervous arm could fling,<br>
When all drew backward on the messy crags<br>
Of the steep bank, and firmly stood unmov'd<br>
As one who walks in doubt might stand to look.<br>
<br>"O spirits perfect!  O already chosen!"<br>
Virgil to them began, "by that blest peace,<br>
Which, as I deem, is for you all prepar'd,<br>
Instruct us where the mountain low declines,<br>
So that attempt to mount it be not vain.<br>
For who knows most, him loss of time most grieves."<br>
<br>As sheep, that step from forth their fold, by one,<br>
Or pairs, or three at once; meanwhile the rest<br>
Stand fearfully, bending the eye and nose<br>
To ground, and what the foremost does, that do<br>
The others, gath'ring round her, if she stops,<br>
Simple and quiet, nor the cause discern;<br>
So saw I moving to advance the first,<br>
Who of that fortunate crew were at the head,<br>
Of modest mien and graceful in their gait.<br>
When they before me had beheld the light<br>
From my right side fall broken on the ground,<br>
So that the shadow reach'd the cave, they stopp'd<br>
And somewhat back retir'd: the same did all,<br>
Who follow'd, though unweeting of the cause.<br>
<br>"Unask'd of you, yet freely I confess,<br>
This is a human body which ye see.<br>
That the sun's light is broken on the ground,<br>
Marvel not: but believe, that not without<br>
Virtue deriv'd from Heaven, we to climb<br>
Over this wall aspire." &nbsp;So them bespake<br>
My master; and that virtuous tribe rejoin'd;<br>
"Turn, and before you there the entrance lies,"<br>
Making a signal to us with bent hands.<br>
<br>Then of them one began. &nbsp;"Whoe'er thou art,<br>
Who journey'st thus this way, thy visage turn,<br>
Think if me elsewhere thou hast ever seen."<br>
<br>I tow'rds him turn'd, and with fix'd eye beheld.<br>
Comely, and fair, and gentle of aspect,<br>
He seem'd, but on one brow a gash was mark'd.<br>
<br>When humbly I disclaim'd to have beheld<br>
Him ever: "Now behold!" &nbsp;he said, and show'd<br>
High on his breast a wound: then smiling spake.<br>
<br>"I am Manfredi, grandson to the Queen<br>
Costanza: whence I pray thee, when return'd,<br>
To my fair daughter go, the parent glad<br>
Of Aragonia and Sicilia's pride;<br>
And of the truth inform her, if of me<br>
Aught else be told. &nbsp;When by two mortal blows<br>
My frame was shatter'd, I betook myself<br>
Weeping to him, who of free will forgives.<br>
My sins were horrible; but so wide arms<br>
Hath goodness infinite, that it receives<br>
All who turn to it. &nbsp;Had this text divine<br>
Been of Cosenza's shepherd better scann'd,<br>
Who then by Clement on my hunt was set,<br>
Yet at the bridge's head my bones had lain,<br>
Near Benevento, by the heavy mole<br>
Protected; but the rain now drenches them,<br>
And the wind drives, out of the kingdom's bounds,<br>
Far as the stream of Verde, where, with lights<br>
Extinguish'd, he remov'd them from their bed.<br>
Yet by their curse we are not so destroy'd,<br>
But that the eternal love may turn, while hope<br>
Retains her verdant blossoms. &nbsp;True it is,<br>
That such one as in contumacy dies<br>
Against the holy church, though he repent,<br>
Must wander thirty-fold for all the time<br>
In his presumption past; if such decree<br>
Be not by prayers of good men shorter made<br>
Look therefore if thou canst advance my bliss;<br>
Revealing to my good Costanza, how<br>
Thou hast beheld me, and beside the terms<br>
Laid on me of that interdict; for here<br>
By means of those below much profit comes."</p>

Entire the soul collects herself, it seems<br>
She is intent upon that power alone,<br>
And thus the error is disprov'd which holds<br>
The soul not singly lighted in the breast.<br>
And therefore when as aught is heard or seen,<br>
That firmly keeps the soul toward it turn'd,<br>
Time passes, and a man perceives it not.<br>
For that, whereby he hearken, is one power,<br>
Another that, which the whole spirit hash;<br>
This is as it were bound, while that is free.<br>
<br>This found I true by proof, hearing that spirit<br>
And wond'ring; for full fifty steps aloft<br>
The sun had measur'd unobserv'd of me,<br>
When we arriv'd where all with one accord<br>
The spirits shouted, "Here is what ye ask."<br>
<br>A larger aperture ofttimes is stopp'd<br>
With forked stake of thorn by villager,<br>
When the ripe grape imbrowns, than was the path,<br>
By which my guide, and I behind him close,<br>
Ascended solitary, when that troop<br>
Departing left us. &nbsp;On Sanleo's road<br>
Who journeys, or to Noli low descends,<br>
Or mounts Bismantua's height, must use his feet;<br>
But here a man had need to fly, I mean<br>
With the swift wing and plumes of high desire,<br>
Conducted by his aid, who gave me hope,<br>
And with light furnish'd to direct my way.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/04-31.jpg"><img alt="04-31th.jpg (44K)" src="images/04-31th.jpg" height="476" width="434"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<br>We through the broken rock ascended, close<br>
Pent on each side, while underneath the ground<br>
Ask'd help of hands and feet. &nbsp;When we arriv'd<br>
Near on the highest ridge of the steep bank,<br>
Where the plain level open'd I exclaim'd,<br>
"O master! say which way can we proceed?"<br>
<br>He answer'd, "Let no step of thine recede.<br>
Behind me gain the mountain, till to us<br>
Some practis'd guide appear." &nbsp;That eminence<br>
Was lofty that no eye might reach its point,<br>
And the side proudly rising, more than line<br>
From the mid quadrant to the centre drawn.<br>
I wearied thus began: "Parent belov'd!<br>
Turn, and behold how I remain alone,<br>
If thou stay not."&mdash;"My son!" &nbsp;He straight reply'd,<br>
"Thus far put forth thy strength;" and to a track<br>
Pointed, that, on this side projecting, round<br>
Circles the hill. &nbsp;His words so spurr'd me on,<br>
That I behind him clamb'ring, forc'd myself,<br>
Till my feet press'd the circuit plain beneath.<br>
There both together seated, turn'd we round<br>
To eastward, whence was our ascent: and oft<br>
Many beside have with delight look'd back.<br>
<br>First on the nether shores I turn'd my eyes,<br>
Then rais'd them to the sun, and wond'ring mark'd<br>
That from the left it smote us. &nbsp;Soon perceiv'd<br>
That Poet sage now at the car of light<br>
Amaz'd I stood, where 'twixt us and the north<br>
Its course it enter'd. &nbsp;Whence he thus to me:<br>
"Were Leda's offspring now in company<br>
Of that broad mirror, that high up and low<br>
Imparts his light beneath, thou might'st behold<br>
The ruddy zodiac nearer to the bears<br>
Wheel, if its ancient course it not forsook.<br>
How that may be if thou would'st think; within<br>
Pond'ring, imagine Sion with this mount<br>
Plac'd on the earth, so that to both be one<br>
Horizon, and two hemispheres apart,<br>
Where lies the path that Phaeton ill knew<br>
To guide his erring chariot: thou wilt see<br>
How of necessity by this on one<br>
He passes, while by that on the' other side,<br>
If with clear view shine intellect attend."<br>
<br>"Of truth, kind teacher!" &nbsp;I exclaim'd, "so clear<br>
Aught saw I never, as I now discern<br>
Where seem'd my ken to fail, that the mid orb<br>
Of the supernal motion (which in terms<br>
Of art is called the Equator, and remains<br>
Ever between the sun and winter) for the cause<br>
Thou hast assign'd, from hence toward the north<br>
Departs, when those who in the Hebrew land<br>
Inhabit, see it tow'rds the warmer part.<br>
But if it please thee, I would gladly know,<br>
How far we have to journey: for the hill<br>
Mounts higher, than this sight of mine can mount."<br>
<br>He thus to me: "Such is this steep ascent,<br>
That it is ever difficult at first,<br>
But, more a man proceeds, less evil grows.<br>
When pleasant it shall seem to thee, so much<br>
That upward going shall be easy to thee.<br>
As in a vessel to go down the tide,<br>
Then of this path thou wilt have reach'd the end.<br>
There hope to rest thee from thy toil. &nbsp;No more<br>
I answer, and thus far for certain know."<br>
As he his words had spoken, near to us<br>
A voice there sounded: "Yet ye first perchance<br>
May to repose you by constraint be led."<br>
At sound thereof each turn'd, and on the left<br>
A huge stone we beheld, of which nor I<br>
Nor he before was ware. &nbsp;Thither we drew,<br>
find there were some, who in the shady place<br>
Behind the rock were standing, as a man<br>
Thru' idleness might stand. &nbsp;Among them one,<br>
Who seem'd to me much wearied, sat him down,<br>
And with his arms did fold his knees about,<br>
Holding his face between them downward bent.<br>


<br><br><br><br>
<a href="images/04-100.jpg"><img alt="04-100th.jpg (63K)" src="images/04-100th.jpg" height="547" width="430"></a>
<br><br><br><br>


<br>"Sweet Sir!" &nbsp;I cry'd, "behold that man, who shows<br>
Himself more idle, than if laziness<br>
Were sister to him." &nbsp;Straight he turn'd to us,<br>
And, o'er the thigh lifting his face, observ'd,<br>
Then in these accents spake: "Up then, proceed<br>
Thou valiant one." &nbsp;Straight who it was I knew;<br>
Nor could the pain I felt (for want of breath<br>
Still somewhat urg'd me) hinder my approach.<br>
And when I came to him, he scarce his head<br>
Uplifted, saying "Well hast thou discern'd,<br>
How from the left the sun his chariot leads."<br>
<br>His lazy acts and broken words my lips<br>
To laughter somewhat mov'd; when I began:<br>
"Belacqua, now for thee I grieve no more.<br>
But tell, why thou art seated upright there?<br>
Waitest thou escort to conduct thee hence?<br>
Or blame I only shine accustom'd ways?"<br>
Then he: "My brother, of what use to mount,<br>
When to my suffering would not let me pass<br>
The bird of God, who at the portal sits?<br>
Behooves so long that heav'n first bear me round<br>
Without its limits, as in life it bore,<br>
Because I to the end repentant Sighs<br>
Delay'd, if prayer do not aid me first,<br>
That riseth up from heart which lives in grace.<br>
What other kind avails, not heard in heaven?"'<br>
<br>Before me now the Poet up the mount<br>
Ascending, cried: "Haste thee, for see the sun<br>
Has touch'd the point meridian, and the night<br>
Now covers with her foot Marocco's shore."</p>

one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to

Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.net

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
